These are web programming projects I completed under the instruction of Todd Sproull at Washington University in St. Louis.
They demonstrate the basics of PHP, MySQL, Python, and (hopefully) good web programming practices.
Note: The group projects were completed with the help of my partner, Frank Sun.
